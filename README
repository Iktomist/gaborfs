here are my personal notes to myself that spawned the idea:

when renderer is fixed, containerize this linux, render all images in cloud, train a neural datastructure for compression and gradient-domain processing, print non-fungible tokens and auto-post to all social medias with free timecoin value redeemable in terms of the minutes in their topology.

so the same datastructure can do many things that are almost OS, and the bytecodelang I'm writing that aquinas actually is, isn't just something that communicates with the utmost attention to those fractal details of neural compression in the filesystem.

it's easy to deploy as a version of ubuntu if the filesystem is just based on neural compression; easy to modify the reiserfs???

gotta be easier than writing it from scratch.

hope people will join me on this weird journey; a filesystem that prints nfts? based not just on neural compression but on the structure of the brains of those things that go tweet?

but so far this fork is just a readme.

stay tuned! ^_^
